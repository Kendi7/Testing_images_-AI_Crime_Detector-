## 🔍 AI Crime Detector – Weapon Image Dataset

This repository contains a curated collection of **images featuring various weapon-like objects** (including **stones, knives, pangas, rungus, and guns**) intended **solely for the purpose of training and testing AI-based object detection models**. The goal is to build a real-time **AI Crime Detection System** capable of analyzing surveillance footage or submitted images, identifying potential threats, and **alerting responsible security or law enforcement authorities** in a timely and accurate manner.

### ⚠️ Ethical Notice & Disclaimer

> **🚨 WARNING: The images in this repository depict potentially dangerous objects and weaponry.**
>
> They are intended **strictly for academic research, AI training, and development of public safety technology.**
>
> * These images **must not be used to promote violence**, cause panic, or for any malicious activity.
> * The contributors **do not endorse violence or aggression** of any kind.
> * This dataset is released **only for ethical AI development** focused on crime prevention and threat detection.

### 📁 Contents

The image categories in this repository include:

* 🪨 **Stones** – Used in unrest or riots
* 🔪 **Knives** – Sharp edged weapons
* 🪓 **Pangas** – Machete-like tools, common in rural settings
* 🔨 **Rungus** – Traditional clubs or blunt weapons
* 🔫 **Guns** – Includes pistols and rifles

These images are being tested for detection accuracy by object recognition models such as **YOLO, DETR, Grounding DINO**, and others used in crime-prevention AI systems.

### 🧠 Project Objective

To train and test a computer vision model that can:

* Detect presence of a weapon or dangerous object
* Classify the type of weapon accurately
* Trigger alerts to security personnel or authorities for rapid response

This initiative supports efforts in **public safety, surveillance automation, and crime reporting**, especially in **high-risk or low-surveillance areas.**

### 📌 Contribution & Use

We welcome contributors working on:

* Object detection model improvement
* Image labeling and dataset cleaning
* Deployment and real-time alerting systems

> ✅ Use this dataset responsibly.
> ❌ Do not use it to simulate, promote, or replicate any real-life violent actions.
